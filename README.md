# Grocery-list
A Grocery List Application: This project can be built using JavaScript and React for the front-end, and a database such as MongoDB to store the grocery list items. The user can create, read, update, and delete items from the list, and the application can also include a feature to mark items as "purchased" and filter the list to show only items that still need to be bought. Additionally, the user can add items to the list by scanning barcodes or searching for specific products. The application can also include a feature to generate a shopping list based on the user's past purchases and frequently bought items. The application can also include a feature to share the grocery list with others, such as roommates or family members, and allow them to add or remove items from the list.
